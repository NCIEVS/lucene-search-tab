    <h1>Lucene Search</h1>

    The Lucene Search plugin provides a high-performance search capability
    useful for searching text in very large ontologies (e.g., NCI
    Thesaurus, Gene Ontology, SNOMED-CT, etc.).<br><br>

    The plugin comes with a GUI for formulating queries, and viewing and
    exporting the results.
